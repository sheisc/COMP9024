# COMP9024


<!--
As suggested by the [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), Python and C stand out as the two most 
popular programming languages.

Python, introduced in COMP9021, provides a higher-level abstraction (e.g., garbage collection).
Known for its simplicity and versatility, Python has gained widespread adoption in various domains, 
from web development and software security to AI. 

On the other hand, C, renowned for its efficiency and control over hardware, remains a cornerstone in system programming (e.g., [Linux Kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) and [Python Interpreter](https://github.com/python/cpython)) and embedded systems. 

Interestingly, the official Python interpreter, [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython), is written in C.

COMP9024 is a 2-in-1 course.  It consists of two parts:

1. The C Programming Language

2. Data Structures and Algorithms

Together, we have **Data Structures and Algorithms in C**.

But, we don’t have the luxury of learning the C programming language through traditional methods (like those used in [COMP1511](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/24T2/)).

It means:

- On one hand, you pay for one course but get the content of two (C + Data Structures and Algorithms).

- On the other hand, COMP9024 has a steep learning curve.

**Please work hard in Week 1 and harder after that**.

To aid understanding, we have visualized most of the algorithms (e.g., [COMP9024/Trees/Ast2Dot](./Trees/Ast2Dot/README.md)) discussed in COMP9024.

## [Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_%2B_Data_Structures_%3D_Programs)


Data structures are about how data is stored inside a computer for effective and efficient use. 


An algorithm is a step-by-step process for solving a problem within a finite amount of space and time. 


|       | Examples      | In C |
| :----- | :----------: | :----------: |
| Data Structures (data)| arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, ...   |  pointer, array, struct, ... |
| Algorithms (code)     | tree traversal, sorting, searching, graph traversal, ...  | expression, statement, function |
